# The DMX configuration for mtrack. This maps OLA universes to light show names defined within
# song files.
dmx:
  # The DMX engine in mtrack has a dimming engine that can be issued using MIDI program change (PC) commands.
  # This modifier is multiplied by the value of the PC command to give a dimming duration, e.g.
  # PC1 * 1.0 dim speed modifier = 1.0 second dim time
  # PC1 * 0.25 dim speed modifier = 0.25 second dim time
  # PC5 * 0.25 dim speed modifier = 1.25 second dim time
  dim_speed_modifier: 0.25

  # (Optional) Once a song is started, mtrack will wait this amount before triggering the DMX playback.
